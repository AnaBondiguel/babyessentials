# R7. Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.
I’d like to build a two-sided market for helping parents to sell and buy the second-hand baby essentials. Kids grow up quickly. Many baby essentials like bassinet and car seat, are still quite new after six-months to three years. Parents can get rid of the baby items when they don’t need them any more without losing too much money. They also can buy a cheaper second-hand products for what they need now.

# R8. Why is it a problem that needs solving?
Many parents experienced that they had a lot of baby essentials left in their storage room when their kids grew up. It occupies so much spaces at home. If parents discard themw, it’s wasted and not environmental friendly. Also, some parents would buy things before their baby born, such as cot, pram, and sleeping bags etc. However, it might be end up that they haven’t used them at all or only used several times or the products weren’t not right, they need to buy another type for the replacement. In order to save environment and parents money, I’d like to build a two-market place for parents to buy and sell their baby essentials.

# R12. User stories for your app
As mums, my friends and I want to get rid of our baby items for the rooms because they grew up. We don't need bassinet, baby capsule, baby walk, baby bouncer etc. anymore, but they are still in a very good condition (some baby products have never been used or used once). We think other parents who have newborn babies may need these baby items. We also would like to purchase toddler or kid essentials from other parents, such as bunk bed, bookshelf, desk, raincoat, bike etc. Therefore, we can recycle those baby/kid items in our community and be environmental friendly.
